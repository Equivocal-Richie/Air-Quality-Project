## Comprehensive Outlier Handling Strategy:

**Understanding the Data:** As a data scientist, I recognize that air quality and weather data are inherently noisy. Outliers can represent genuine extreme events (pollution spikes, storms) or measurement errors. My approach will be to balance statistical methods with domain knowledge, preventing the loss of valuable information while mitigating the impact of erroneous data.

**Method Selection:**

* **Capping/Flooring with Dynamic Thresholds:** Instead of fixed thresholds, I'll use dynamic thresholds based on the data's distribution and domain-specific knowledge. This allows for adaptability to varying data ranges and avoids arbitrary cutoffs.
* 
* **Robust Statistical Measures:** I'll favor robust statistical measures like the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) over standard deviation, as MAD is less sensitive to outliers.
* 
* **Conditional Outlier Handling:** I'll apply outlier handling conditionally, based on the specific characteristics of each variable.

   
 **Explanation:**

    * The `robust_cap_floor` function uses the MAD to determine dynamic capping and flooring thresholds.
    * For AQI, PM2.5, and PM10, I've used the 99th percentile as a cap, recognizing that extreme pollution events are valid.
    * For humidity and pressure, I've set logical boundaries (0 for humidity, 1st percentile for pressure).
    * Wind speed is capped at the 99th percentile.

## Automated Checks for Inconsistencies:

* **Data Validation Function:** Create a function to perform automated checks on incoming data.

    
**Explanation:**

    * The `validate_data` function checks for null timestamps and logical ranges for numerical variables.
    * The `check_for_inconsistencies` function logs any validation failures.

## Alerting System:

* **Email Alerts:** Integrate an email alerting system to notify you of data inconsistencies. For the purposes of this example, I will show how to log the errors.

    
**Explanation:**

    * The `send_alert_email` function sends an email alert with the error messages.
    * The `check_for_inconsistencies` function now sends an email if any validation checks fail.

## Scheduling:

* Schedule the `check_for_inconsistencies` function to run periodically (e.g., hourly) using `schedule`.
